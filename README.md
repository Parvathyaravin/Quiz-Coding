# <Creating Coding Quiz>

## Description

The primary aim of this project was to establish a platform where users could assess their coding knowledge or refresh their understanding of coding basics. Upon clicking the "Start Quiz" button, the quiz initiates, accompanied by a 90-second timer. Each correctly selected answer awards the user ten points, while an incorrect choice incurs a penalty, reducing their total time by ten seconds. Upon quiz completion, users are prompted to input their initials. The "High Score" page showcases the initials of the user with the highest score, providing an option to restart the quiz. This hands-on experience has underscored the practical benefits of jQuery in simplifying developers' lives, highlighted the challenges of refactoring jQuery code into vanilla JavaScript, emphasized the significance of the order of operations when invoking specific functions, and underscored the importance of overall code cleanliness and organization.
